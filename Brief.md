Holidays Property Management App

A holidays property manager (co-host) has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their bookings, guests and properties on a digital agenda they can edit freely.
A property may be rented to many guests at a time. A guest is registered with only one holiday property.


***MVP***

The co-host wants to be able to register / track guests,

Be able to assign guests to holiday properties, be able to create bookings,

CRUD actions for holiday properties / guests / bookings,

The views should allow the co-host to see bookings, guests and properties.



***Possible Extensions***



There should be a search tab with autocomplete enabling the property manager to search for guests and properties,



The views should allow the co-host to see bookings, guests and properties sorted by all parameters,

If a property has multiple guests we don't want to keep updating contact details separately for each guest. Extend your 
application to reflect that a property can have many guests and to more sensibly keep track of guests' details (avoiding 
repetition / inconsistencies),

Guests who are not over 21 or have no documents should not be able to book,

Groups bigger than the property sleeps number should not be able to book,

The guest could have a budget and properties a daily fee: if guests donâ€™t reach the total fee they should not be able to 
book,

Handle check-in / check-out dates,

Let the co-host see all guests currently in the property (today's date is between the check-in and check-out?),

Co-hosts usually want to retain the good clientele and a powerful retention tool is discounts: build an extension to offer a 
20% off the next booking,

Add extra functionality of your choosing - calculating the earning per booking after commissions, providing services (late 
check-in, bike rentals etc).
